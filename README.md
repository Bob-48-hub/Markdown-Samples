### Paragraphs

Writing normal text is straight forward. You just type it out.
If you press enter once the following text is added on to what you just typed.

If you press enter twice then you get a new paragraph with a line space between them.  
If you want a new paragraph without the line space between them then put two spaces at the end of the paragraph before it.

### Bold Text

The text that you want to make **bold has 2\* before and after the text**. Or you can use a **double \_underscore before and after to bold the text**.

### Italic Text

The text that you want to make _italic has 1\* before and after the text_. Or you can use a _single \_underscore before and after to bold the text_.  
To make text **_both bold and italic_** you surround the text with 3\*, or **_3 \_underscores_**.
